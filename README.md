# Injective Domain Contract Example

This Next.js app is an example of how to implement the connection and interact with a Smart Contract deployed on the Injective Chain using the `injective-ts` module.

More about `injective-ts` here: [injective-ts wiki](https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/injective-ts/wiki)

## Preparation

Start by installing the node module dependencies you are going to use (like `@injectivelabs/sdk-ts` etc...)

We can see the modules used in this example in `package.json`

Unlike Nuxt,when using Next.js you dont need to configure anything, Next.js takes care of it automatically.
